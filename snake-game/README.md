## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation & Running

#### Option 1: Using Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to the game directory
cd snake-game

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the game
python main.py
```

#### Option 2: System-wide Installation
```bash
# Install pygame system-wide (if allowed)
pip install pygame>=2.0.0

# Run the game
python main.py
```

#### Option 3: Using pipx (Alternative)
```bash
# If you have pipx installed
pipx run --spec pygame python main.py
```

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run `python main.py`
2. **Control the Snake**: Use arrow keys or WASD to move
3. **Eat Food**: Guide your snake to the glowing golden food
4. **Avoid Collisions**: Don't hit walls or your own body
5. **Beat High Scores**: Try to achieve the highest score possible
6. **Restart**: Press Space when game over, or Escape to quit

## üé® Game Elements

- **Snake Head**: Bright magenta circle with white eye
- **Snake Body**: Purple segments that fade as they get longer
- **Food**: Golden, pulsing circle with glow effects
- **Trail**: Fading light trail behind the snake
- **Particles**: Explosion effects for visual feedback

## üîß Customization

You can easily customize the game by modifying the constants in `main.py`:

```python
# Window size
WINDOW_WIDTH = 1000
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 700

# Grid size (affects snake/food size)
GRID_SIZE = 20

# Colors
SNAKE_HEAD_COLOR = (255, 100, 255)  # Bright magenta
FOOD_COLOR = (255, 215, 0)          # Gold
BACKGROUND_COLOR = (15, 15, 35)     # Dark blue

# Game speed (lower = faster)
self.clock.tick(10)  # In the Game.run() method
```

## üì¶ Dependencies

- **pygame**: Game development library for graphics and input handling

See `requirements.txt` for exact version requirements.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"externally-managed-environment" error**:
   - Use a virtual environment (see Option 1 above)
   - Or use `pip install --break-system-packages pygame` (not recommended)

2. **"No module named pygame"**:
   - Make sure pygame is installed: `pip install pygame`
   - Verify your virtual environment is activated

3. **Game window doesn't open**:
   - Ensure you have a display/GUI environment
   - Check if running in a headless environment

4. **Performance issues**:
   - Close other applications to free up resources
   - Adjust `GRID_SIZE` for better performance on older hardware

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Graphics display capability
- Keyboard input support
- At least 50MB free RAM

## üéØ Game Tips

- **Strategy**: Plan your moves ahead to avoid trapping yourself
- **Speed**: The game runs at a fixed speed, focus on precision
- **High Scores**: Longer snakes = higher scores, but more challenge
- **Visual Cues**: Use the trail and glow effects to judge distances
